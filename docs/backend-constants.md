# Frontend localization constants

These dicts mirror the canonical backend data so the frontend can render localized strings without the
backend shipping English prose. Keep in sync with `board_data.py` and `cards_data.py` if either
changes.

---

## Tiles

Board positions 0–39. Non-purchasable squares (corners, tax, chance, chest) are included so every
`tile_id` in a log entry can be resolved to a display name.

```js
const TILES = {
  0: "TYCOON", // GO corner
  1: "Mediterranean Ave",
  2: "Community Chest",
  3: "Baltic Ave",
  4: "Income Tax",
  5: "Reading Railroad",
  6: "Oriental Ave",
  7: "Chance",
  8: "Vermont Ave",
  9: "Connecticut Ave",
  10: "Just Visiting", // Jail / visiting corner
  11: "St. Charles Place",
  12: "Electric Company",
  13: "States Ave",
  14: "Virginia Ave",
  15: "Pennsylvania Railroad",
  16: "St. James Place",
  17: "Community Chest",
  18: "Tennessee Ave",
  19: "New York Ave",
  20: "Free Parking",
  21: "Kentucky Ave",
  22: "Chance",
  23: "Indiana Ave",
  24: "Illinois Ave",
  25: "B&O Railroad",
  26: "Atlantic Ave",
  27: "Ventnor Ave",
  28: "Water Works",
  29: "Marvin Gardens",
  30: "Go to Jail",
  31: "Pacific Ave",
  32: "North Carolina Ave",
  33: "Community Chest",
  34: "Pennsylvania Ave",
  35: "Short Line Railroad",
  36: "Chance",
  37: "Park Place",
  38: "Luxury Tax",
  39: "Boardwalk",
};
```

  chance_03: "Advance to St. Charles Place. If you pass GO, collect $200",

```

### Community Chest (`card_kind: "community_chest"`)

## Event log `type` templates

Each `LogEntry` with `kind: "event"` carries a `type` and structured fields. Use these to build
localized display strings. Field names match the wire schema exactly.

| `type`               | Suggested English template                                                                                                                                                                               |

## Expected JSON shapes from the backend

All responses are `snake_case`. Null-valued optional fields are omitted by Pydantic's `model_dump`.
The examples below show only the non-null fields that appear for each case.

### `active_card` (inside `game.state` payload)

Appears briefly after a player draws a Chance or Community Chest card; clears on the next command.
Effect is a discriminated union on `effect.type` — all variants shown below.

```jsonc

### `log[]` entries (inside `game.state` payload)

Every game-event entry has `"kind": "event"`. Only fields relevant to that `type` are present;
all other optional fields are omitted. `player_name` and `player_token` are convenience fallbacks —
prefer resolving from `player_id` against the `players` array when possible.

```jsonc
// player_moved — dice roll (rolled present)

## Rendering log entries (TypeScript / TSX)

### Types

```typescript
// Mirrors the wire schema exactly. All optional fields are absent when null —
// Pydantic strips null-valued fields, so check with `!= null` not `!== undefined`.
interface LogEntry {
  id: string;
  kind: "event" | "chat" | "sticker";
  ts: string; // ISO-8601
  type?: string;
  player_id?: string;
  player_name?: string;
  player_token?: string;
  opponent_id?: string;
  tile_id?: number;
  rolled?: number;
  spent?: number;
  received?: number;
  card_id?: string;
  card_kind?: string;
  reason?: string;
  streak?: number;
  strikes?: number;
  // Only present on chat/sticker entries (or games persisted before this schema).
  text?: string;
  sticker_url?: string;
}
```

### `formatLogEntry` — plain string renderer

```typescript
/**
 * Produce a single human-readable line for one log entry.
 *
 * Example:
 *   const entry = {
 *     id: "…", kind: "event", ts: "…",
 *     type: "player_moved",
 *     player_name: "Test",
 *     tile_id: 1,   // Mediterranean Ave
 *     rolled: 7,
 *   };
 *   formatLogEntry(entry); // → "Test rolled 7 and went to Mediterranean Ave"
 */

### TSX component

```tsx
import React from "react";

interface LogFeedProps {
  entries: LogEntry[];
}

export function LogFeed({ entries }: LogFeedProps) {
  return (
    <ul className="log-feed">
      {entries.map((entry) => (
        <li key={entry.id} className={`log-entry log-entry--${entry.kind}`}>
          <span className="log-entry__text">{formatLogEntry(entry)}</span>
          <time className="log-entry__ts" dateTime={entry.ts}>
            {new Date(entry.ts).toLocaleTimeString()}
          </time>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

### Concrete walkthrough

The wire frame that produces `"Test rolled 7 and went to Mediterranean Ave"`:

```jsonc
// Inside game.state → payload.log
{
  "id": "6a1addb5fa3443a0b434bcb1a1625fea",
  "kind": "event",
  "ts": "2026-06-07T21:57:25.092746Z",
  "type": "player_moved",
  "player_name": "Test",
  "tile_id": 1, // TILES["1"] = "Mediterranean Ave"
  "rolled": 7, // present → use the "rolled N and went to …" template
}
```

Step by step through `formatLogEntry`:

1. `entry.kind === "event"` and `entry.type === "player_moved"` → hits the `player_moved` case.
2. `name = entry.player_name` → `"Test"`.
3. `tile = TILES[1]` → `"Mediterranean Ave"`.
4. `entry.rolled != null` → `true` (value is `7`).
5. Returns `` `${name} rolled ${entry.rolled} and went to ${tile}` `` →
   **`"Test rolled 7 and went to Mediterranean Ave"`**.

For a card-induced move (no dice roll, `rolled` field absent):

```jsonc
{ "type": "player_moved", "player_name": "Test", "tile_id": 1 }
// → "Test moved to Mediterranean Ave"
```
